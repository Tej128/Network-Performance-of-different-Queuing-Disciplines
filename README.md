# COMPARISON OF NETWORK PERFORMANCES FOR QUEUING DISCIPLINES IN A MULTIPLE LINK, SHARING A BUFFER AND IMPACT OF ADAPTIVE QUEUING

The codes explore the performance of different queuing disciplines in a complex networking scenario where multiple links converge to share a common buffer. The study goes beyond traditional queuing analyses by introducing the concept of adaptive queuing" and compares with the non-adaptive queuing disciplines
WHAT ARE WE CURIOUS TO FIND, UNDERSTAND AND INVESTIGATE?
• Observation of different points of view i.e., from buffer and links.
• (In either of the network elements – Buffers and Links) Impact of 
  o multiple parallel arrival sources with a shared queue.
  o Scheduling policies or queuing disciplines in buffers and links.
  o Adaptive queuing in different queuing disciplines
• Performance metrics of the above observations. 

WHAT KIND OF SYSTEM IS OURS? 2 VIEWS!
1) Buffer - Point of view - M/M/1:SP (Scheduling Policy)
2) SP’s OBSERVED IN LINKS POINT OF VIEW with M/M/1 buffer.
We considered SP --> Scheduling Policies on links and in the buffer. FIFO, LIFO, Priority.
Kendal’s or Erlang Notation:
A/B/S/K: SP where
• A refers to the packet arrival process, i.e., the interarrival time distribution for that process.
• B refers to the packet service process i.e., the interservice time distribution for that process.
• S refers to the number of servers (i.e. transmitters or processors). 
• K refers to the total number of packets that can be stored in the queueing system, including those 
in the buffer and those in service.
